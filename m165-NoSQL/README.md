# NoSQL Datenbanken

> NoSQL databases (AKA "not only SQL") store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are 
> document
> , key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of big data and high user loads.

# ACID (SQL) vs. BASE (NoSQL)

> ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee reliable processing of database transactions. BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) is an alternative to ACID that allows for more flexibility and scalability in distributed systems.

# CAP Theorem

> The CAP theorem states that a distributed data store can only provide two of the following three guarantees at the same time: consistency, availability, and partition tolerance.
