## Get Started with Vercel

1. Clone the Repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sxpersxnic/TBZ.git
   cd TBZ.
   ```

2. Set the Environment variables according to `.env.example`
3. Create an account on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/login)
4. Link your Github, Gitlab or BitBucket Account.
5. Create a Remote Repository on Github/Gitlab/BitBucket
6. Push the Local Repository to your *Remote*
7. Import the Repository to *Vercel*
8. Upload your `.env` to Vercel `your-project > Settings > Environment Variables`
9. Setup a *PostgreSQL* Database on Vercel `your-project > Storage`

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > Vercels PostgreSQL Database service is not available anymore. Use the [Neon](https://neon.tech/) service instead.

10. Seed your database by either navigating to the api route in your current deployment `url-to-your-deployment/api/seed`.
    If you prefer to seed the database locally, read the following guide to get your app running locally.

## Get Started Locally

1. Clone the Repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sxpersxnic/TBZ.git
   cd TBZ.
   ```

2. Setup a *PostgreSQL* Database, see [Postgres Guide](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-start.html)
3. Set the Environment variables according to `.env.example` in a new file `.env.local`
4. Install the dependencies, for development I used **pnpm**, but feel free to choose an other package manager.
   Run the command using your chosen package manager:

   ```sh
     pnpm install
     # or
     npm install
     # or
     yarn install
     # or
     bun install
   ```

5. Run the local development server:

   ```sh
     pnpm dev
     # or
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     # or
     bun dev
   ```

6. Finally seed your database by navigating to the api route `http://localhost:3000/api/seed` .

Don't worry if you want to deploy your project later on, just follow the [guide above](#get-started-with-vercel).

## Technical details

### [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

Under the hood, Next.js also abstracts and automatically configures tooling needed for React, like bundling, compiling, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.

Whether you're an individual developer or part of a larger team, Next.js can help you build interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

### [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/)

TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor.

### [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org/)

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

### [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team)

Drizzle ORM is a headless TypeScript ORM with a head.

It looks and feels simple, performs on day 1000 of your project,
lets you do things your way, and is there when you need it.

It’s the only ORM with both relational and SQL-like query APIs, providing you the best of both worlds when it comes to accessing your relational data. Drizzle is lightweight, performant, typesafe, non-lactose, gluten-free, sober, flexible and serverless-ready by design. Drizzle is not just a library, it’s an experience.

### [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center` and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

### [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Vercel is a platform for developers that provides the tools, workflows, and infrastructure you need to build and deploy your web apps faster, without the need for additional configuration.
Vercel supports popular frontend frameworks out-of-the-box, and its scalable, secure infrastructure is globally distributed to serve content from data centers near your users for optimal speeds.

During development, Vercel provides tools for real-time collaboration on your projects such as automatic preview and production environments, and comments on preview deployments.
